# Scraping Spotify API

  Every year, spotify produces a playlist for each of its 180 million users with their top 100 played songs of the year. Users look forward to these playlist and often share their results online. Through the Spotify web API, it's possible to download the data from one's top 100 playlist and conduct data analysis to analyze trends in listening.
